# Design Foundation

> **What this is**: The workspace's style-neutral methodology for deriving a project's own design system.
> **What this is NOT**: A design system. It prescribes no colors, fonts, spacing values, or visual trends.
>
> **Foundation ≠ Design System.** This document tells you *what* a project must define. The project's actual
> design system is its own `docs/design.md` (project SSOT). Design selection happens at the project level —
> never at workspace or template level.

- **Scope**: All projects scaffolded from this template
- **Normative source**: `docs/designs/2026-08-30-design-foundation-design.md` (L0)
- **Companion artifacts**: `docs/design-tokens.template.css` (token scaffold), `design-foundation` skill (derivation procedure)
- **Reference implementation**: `templates/co-design/tokens.json` + `scripts/compile-tokens.ts`

## 1. Normative Principles

1. Theme variation SHALL be expressed primarily through semantic-token mapping; primitive tokens SHOULD remain theme-neutral.
2. Design decisions SHOULD record domain evidence/principle rationale so that the provenance chain
   **Domain Evidence → Design Principle → Design Decision → Token → Component** can be reconstructed.

## 2. Derivation Procedure (overview)

The `design-foundation` skill walks a project through these stages. Each stage consumes the previous one:

| Stage | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1. Domain Evidence | PRD/SRS, user profiles, operating context | Evidence list (density needs, data criticality, audience, regulatory constraints) |
| 2. Design Principles | Evidence list | 3–6 numbered principles with per-principle rationale |
| 3. Design Decisions | Principles | `design_decisions` record (§4) — every selection justified by a principle |
| 4. Token Architecture | Decisions | Token file implementing §5 |
| 5. Components | Tokens | UI consuming component tokens only |
| 6. Validation | Everything | §7 validation contract |

## 2b. Process Pipeline & Design-Phase Gate (v1.1 — from variant practice, ADR-0066)

Deriving a design system is not one task; it is a **fixed order of layers** where each layer
consumes the previous one. The order is normative for any project with UI; the *content* of
each layer is project-specific and style-neutral — this template never prescribes colors,
fonts, icon sets, interaction patterns, or layout patterns.

```
① Principles  →  ② Tokens  →  ③ Style guide & color system  →  ④ Iconography
→  ⑤ Components  →  ⑥ Screen patterns  →  ⑦ Screens
```

Rules:

1. **A layer must not be built before its predecessor exists.** Components reference
   component tokens only; screens compose from declared patterns; new patterns require a
   design-document revision (and, where the project uses ADRs, an ADR).
2. **Tokens are data.** Declare the single source (e.g. `design-tokens.json` per the
   co-design reference implementation, or the token CSS scaffold) and treat compiled
   CSS/output as derived. Semantic-only classes without a declared source are a defect.
3. **Interaction standards are declared, not improvised** — create/add, edit, delete
   (label, confirmation, placement) is written down once and linted; this document does
   not dictate what the standard is.
4. **Design-phase gate**: a design document for a new screen/feature SHALL state
   (a) the screen pattern(s) used, (b) tokens and components consumed (new ones approved
   here, not during implementation), (c) conformance to the project's declared interaction
   standards, (d) icon-vocabulary registration if icons are involved. Review ownership
   follows the project's own review chain.
5. **Enforcement SHOULD be automated** (a design-lint script: banned hard-coded values,
   bypassed layout primitives, non-registered icons/labels). See the checklist template:
   `docs/_templates/design-review-checklist-template.md`.

Stage-table mapping (see §2) is unaffected — this pipeline governs *systemization order*,
the stages above govern *derivation content*.

## 3. Design Principles — how to derive them

Principles are derived from the project's domain, not from trends. Proven pattern (drawn from co-price
"Strategic Financial Aesthetics" and co-newbiz "Onyx 3.0" — as examples of *method*, not styles to copy):

- **Density**: What information density does the domain require? (e.g., expert consoles favor dense-but-legible; consumer onboarding favors breathing room). State the target viewport baseline.
- **Trust & Evidence**: If numbers/provenance are core to the domain, treat them as first-class: dedicated numeric typography, source-linked figures, consistent rendering of identical semantics.
- **Clarity**: Every screen answers "what am I looking at, what can I do, what happens next" at a glance.
- **Guided workflow**: If the domain has stages/processes, the UI reflects where the user stands.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA contrast, visible focus, status never conveyed by color alone.
- **Cognitive load** (ADR-0068): Minimize working-memory and comprehension burden — progressive
  disclosure, chunked input, recognition over recall. State which screens carry the highest
  interaction complexity and how the design bounds it.
- **Error recovery** (ADR-0068): Prevent, forgive, and explain errors — constrained inputs,
  reversible destructive actions, explicit feedback on failure with a recovery path.

Write 3–6 principles. Each must be falsifiable in review ("does this screen satisfy principle N?").
Pair them with operating rules (like co-newbiz's P1–P6) when the project needs machine-checkable constraints.

## 4. Design Decision Record

`docs/design.md` MUST contain a `design_decisions` record. **Every selection carries a `rationale`** — an
agent must never pick a font, color, or library without a traceable reason.

```yaml
design_decisions:
  philosophy:
    - principle: "<principle>"
      rationale: "<domain evidence>"
  color:
    selected: "<system description, e.g. HSL token scale>"
    rationale: "<...>"
  typography:
    body:    { selected: "<font>", rationale: "<...>" }   # primary reading face; Korean-optimized where applicable
    heading: { selected: "<font>", rationale: "<...>" }   # display/heading face
    numeric: { selected: "<font>", rationale: "<...>" }   # figures/IDs; MUST support tabular numerals if numbers are domain-critical
  spacing:   { scale: "<scale>",   rationale: "<...>" }    # e.g. 4px / 8px base grid
  radius:    { scale: "<scale>",   rationale: "<...>" }
  motion:    { policy: "<policy>", rationale: "<...>" }    # e.g. durations, easing curves, reduced-motion policy
  iconography: { library: "<library>", rationale: "<...>" }
```

### Selection criteria (not prescriptions)

| Area | Decide | Criteria |
|------|--------|----------|
| Typography — body | font | Primary-language optimization, screen legibility at 0.8–1rem, licensing |
| Typography — heading | font | Contrast with body, display weights available |
| Typography — numeric | font | **`tabular-nums` support mandatory when figures are domain-critical**; alignment of columns of numbers |
| Color | system + roles | Domain connotation (e.g. finance: profit/loss semantics), AA contrast for all role pairs, brand fit |
| Spacing | base unit | Multiple of 4px or 8px; consistent steps (xs→xl) |
| Radius / shadow | scales | 3–6 steps; match overall density (dense UIs → smaller radii/shadows) |
| Motion | policy | Shared easing curve; durations; `prefers-reduced-motion` behavior |
| Iconography | library | Single library per project; consistent size/stroke defaults; icon-only controls require `aria-label` |

## 5. Token Architecture (normative)

Three layers with a strict reference rule:

```
Primitive Tokens    --color-primary-500, --color-neutral-100 …   (theme-neutral values)
        ↓
Semantic Tokens     --background, --foreground, --border …       (theme-mapped via [data-theme])
        ↓
Component Tokens    --button-primary-bg …                        (semantic-only references)
        ↓
UI Components       (consume component tokens; may also consume semantic tokens directly
                     for one-off cases, but MUST NOT use raw values)
```

Rules:

1. **Semantic tokens reference ONLY primitives. Component tokens reference ONLY semantics.** Bypassing layers is a lint violation (§7).
2. **Theme variation lives in the semantic layer.** Canonical mechanism: `[data-theme="<name>"]` attribute selector
   (workspace convention, aligned with co-design's `compile-tokens.ts`). Do NOT use a `.dark` class mechanism.
3. **Primitives stay theme-neutral**: one value per primitive, independent of theme.
4. **Token contract**: default theme (`:root`) + at least one alternate theme (typically dark), each providing the
   full semantic set including **bg/fg/border triplets** for status semantics (e.g. `--green-bg/fg/border`,
   `--amber-*`, `--red-*`).
5. Include radius, shadow (2–5 steps), and a shared easing/motion token where the domain warrants it.
6. Use `design-tokens.template.css` as the starting scaffold; see co-design's `tokens.json` + `compile-tokens.ts`
   for a working reference implementation (JSON source → compiled CSS/TS forms, themes compiled to
   `[data-theme]` blocks).

## 6. Typography, Iconography & Layout defaults

- **Numeric UI**: wherever figures are domain-critical, use the numeric role font with
  `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` so columns of numbers align vertically.
- **Icons**: one library per project; fixed default size/stroke; every icon-only interactive element carries an
  `aria-label`.
- **Signals are multi-encoded**: status = color + icon + text. Never color alone.
- **Accessibility defaults**: WCAG AA contrast for all semantic role pairs, visible `:focus-visible` state,
  keyboard operability.
- **Layout**: declare the density model (baseline viewport, max content width policy, sidebar/topbar pattern)
  as a decision in `docs/design.md`, not as a default.

## 7. Design Validation Contract

This contract is review-enforced today; automated linting is a tracked backlog item. Where a project has
`token-usage-lint` available (co-design projects), run it — this contract extends, not replaces, it.

### [Required]
- ✓ `docs/design.md` exists with a complete `design_decisions` record
- ✓ Token implementation exists (CSS custom properties, or tokens.json + compiled forms)
- ✓ Default theme + at least one alternate theme of semantic tokens exist
- ✓ bg / fg / border semantic triplets exist for each status color
- ✓ Typography roles defined (body / heading / numeric)
- ✓ Icon library defined
- ✓ WCAG AA target declared
- ✓ Focus state defined
- ✓ Non-color state encoding defined

### [Consistency]
- ✓ Component tokens do not bypass semantic tokens
- ✓ Icon-only buttons have accessible labels
- ✓ Numeric UI uses tabular numerals where appropriate
- ✓ No hard-coded design values in governed components (raw hex, `rgb()`/`hsl()` literals, raw px spacing)

Accessibility verification should use the `accessibility-audit` skill (axe-core, WCAG 2.1 AA) rather than
ad-hoc checks.

This contract covers the **design system** layer. Feature-level accessibility is a separate, mandatory
duty: design docs for user-facing features MUST include an Accessibility section (target level, affected
interaction areas, verification method) per the workspace standard — see `docs/context.md` §
Accessibility Standards and ADR-0065.

## 8. Relationship to Other Workspace Assets

| Asset | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| `templates/co-design/tokens.json` + `scripts/compile-tokens.ts` | Reference implementation of the token architecture |
| `token-usage-lint` skill | Hardcoded-value detection; reused, not duplicated |
| `accessibility-audit` skill | WCAG verification; referenced, not redefined |
| `ui-ux-design-intelligence` skill (co-design) | Downstream: takes over once tokens and decisions exist (`design-foundation` enables it) |
| co-price `docs/design.md`, co-newbiz `docs/design-guide.md` | Originating examples of the *method* (Projects/, not templates) |

## 9. Migration Notes

- co-design's current flat single-layer `tokens.json` remains valid; migrating it to the 3-layer model is a
  tracked backlog item, not part of this Foundation's rollout.
- Existing projects (co-price, co-newbiz) already satisfy this contract substantively; retrofitting the
  `design_decisions` YAML block into their `docs/design.md` is optional and per-project.
