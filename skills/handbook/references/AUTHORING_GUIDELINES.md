# Authoring Guidelines

> This document compiles the principles derived from reviewer feedback received during the creation of
> a **multi-agent team engineering handbook**. It was written so that anyone producing similar
> course materials can use it as a set of guidelines. Each principle originated from an actual
> revision request, and includes both the "why" and "how to apply."

---

## 0. How to Use This Guide

- Before writing a new chapter or hands-on scenario, review **§1–§3** (audience, structure, approach) first.
- When planning course materials, **write the Course Overview (§14) first**, then use its learning objectives to structure the main content.
- After completing a draft, run through the **§A checklist** item by item to catch any omissions.
- Technical accuracy (§4), OS handling (§9), markup details (§11), and **writing style consistency (§12)** are the most frequently flagged areas in reviews — apply them from the draft stage.
- Just before finalizing, run **§19 (Proofreading)** — read every sentence from start to finish.
- When planning course materials, refer to **§20 (Lecture Guide Structure)** to prepare instructor-facing resources alongside.

---

## 1. Target Audience and Depth of Explanation

**Principle**: Write for "someone unfamiliar with this field" as the primary audience, and do not skimp on concept explanations.

- **Why**: Reviewer feedback — *"Overall, the explanations of concepts are too weak."*
- **How to apply**:
  - When introducing a technical term for the first time, add a **one-line analogy** (e.g., orchestrator = symphony conductor).
  - Not only explain "what" but also "why it must be done this way" in one sentence.
  - Structure a section as definition → analogy → hands-on in three parts — beginners can follow along more easily.

---

## 2. Specificity of Hands-On Steps

**Principle**: Break hands-on steps down so they are "copy → paste → run immediately."

- **Why**: Reviewer feedback — *"For the hands-on exercises too, break the steps down very specifically so that after copying and pasting, they can run right away."*
- **How to apply**:
  - Add a **"Copy" button** to each code box using the shared `assets/js/copy-code.js` module. Do not invent separate per-purpose helpers — the canonical implementation handles all cases uniformly.
  - Button markup is exactly: `<button class="copy-btn" aria-label="Copy code">Copy</button>` placed inside the code container (as in `templates/examples.html`). No attributes beyond the class are required — the shared script wires clicks via document-level `.copy-btn` delegation.
  - The implementation extracts code from the button's context: single-target boxes (a `<pre>` block, or a `.prompt-box` with exactly one `<code>` child) resolve via `previousElementSibling` or parent `pre`; multi-line `.prompt-box` boxes authored as separate `<code>` siblings joined by `<br>` are joined with `\n` by the `codes.length > 1` branch.
  - Feedback labels are localized via `COPY_LABELS` keyed on `<html lang>`; the button's initial text stays "Copy" in all languages, only the temporary feedback message localizes. No inline handlers or per-page scripts needed.
  - Do not mix two or more independent actions in a single step (① create file / ② invoke — keep them separate).
  - Terminal commands should be meaningful even on a per-line basis — number them in execution order.

---

## 3. Tool-Neutral Approach (AGENTS.md-First)

**Principle**: Do not teach hands-on exercises tailored to a single tool. **Define the common specification first, then show each tool as an "implementation" of that spec.**

- **Why**: Reviewer feedback — *"The entire course should support multiple tools simultaneously. Base it on AGENTS.md so both Claude and Antigravity can use it."*
- **How to apply**:
  - Write role definitions in plain-text **`AGENTS.md`** specification first — without tool-dependent syntax (`.claude/agents/*.md` YAML, `tools:`, etc.) — covering role/input/output/permissions/handoff.
  - Then show how that **same spec** is implemented as a predefined subagent in the Claude family and as a natural-language goal in the Antigravity family, side by side.
  - Core motto: **"One definition; only the execution method differs per tool."**
  - When execution differs significantly across platforms (code · command · UI steps), separate common concepts and tool-specific implementations into **A/B files** (§18). Guide users to both sides with a 3-link branch nav in the common section.

---

## 4. Technical Accuracy (Pre-Research Required)

**Principle**: Content must not contradict official external sources. When in doubt, research first.

- **Why**: Reviewer feedback — *"There aren't just 3 orchestration patterns — there are more. Research and supplement the content."* (Anthropic officially documents **5 patterns**: prompt chaining, routing, parallelization (sectioning/voting), orchestrator-worker, evaluator-optimizer)
- **How to apply**:
  - Cite official documentation (Anthropic, Antigravity, etc.) as primary authority for numbers, classifications, and naming.
  - Verify that core capabilities (e.g., "dynamic team composition is possible", "multiple workflows can be combined") are not missing from concept or hands-on chapters.
  - When covering inter-document relationships (e.g., `AGENTS.md` ↔ `docs/context.md` ↔ `homecook/docs/context.md`), draw the SSOT/hierarchy accurately.

---

## 4a. No Private-Repository References

**Principle**: Never cite, link to, or instruct readers to `git clone` a private repository. Every command, link, and source a reader is told to use must be reachable by someone with no special access.

- **Why**: A co-consult/co-deck practice handbook told readers to run `git clone https://github.com/5throck/co-consult.git` — but that repository is private, so the exercise failed at step one for any reader without access. The correct source was already public: `templates/co-consult/` inside the public `ai-workspace-standards` repository, reachable via `bun scripts/new-project.ts "<name>" --variant co-consult`.
- **How to apply**:
  - Before writing any `git clone <url>` instruction, verify the target repository is public (check it loads in a private/incognito browser session, or confirm via `gh repo view <owner>/<repo> --json visibility`).
  - When the content lives inside a variant of `ai-workspace-standards` (e.g. `templates/co-consult/`, `templates/co-deck/`), point readers at the public workspace repo and the real scaffolding command (`bun scripts/new-project.ts "<name>" --variant homecook`) — never at a private per-variant repo, even if one exists internally for other purposes.
  - This applies to every reference type, not just clone commands: `<a href>` links, "GitHub repository:" lines, screenshots showing a private repo URL, and code comments.
  - If a source is genuinely private and no public equivalent exists, either omit it or describe the concept without a clickable/copyable pointer a reader would fail to follow — do not silently include an inaccessible link.
  - Applies to both standalone and companion modes, and to every language edition (a link private in one language is private in all).

---

## 5. Generalization of Operational Model Expressions

**Principle**: Do not lock descriptions to a single scale. Express scope in general terms.

- **Why**: Reviewer feedback — *"Saying 'the company operates one multi-agent team' is wrong for large companies — different agent teams could operate per division/team."*
- **How to apply**:
  - Instead of "one team for the whole company," write **"team operations can be organized per organizational unit (division/team)."**
  - In comparisons (service-ticket type vs. variant development-tool type), do not present one side as the correct answer — list pros and cons of both side by side.

---

## 6. Removal of Artificial Constraints

**Principle**: Do not include unnecessary time/scope constraints that burden the learner.

- **Why**: Reviewer feedback — *"The constraint of having to finish within 3 hours is included. Remove the related content."*
- **How to apply**:
  - Exclude time constraints like "within N hours" (time allocation tables are for reference only).
  - After modifying content, **recalculate** the time allocation table so it stays consistent with the body text.

---

## 7. Completing Missing Prerequisites

**Principle**: Do not skip anything assumed to be "obvious." Document all preparation up to the step immediately before the exercise.

- **Why**: Reviewer feedback — *"How to create a GitHub account is missing."*, *"PowerShell must be run as administrator, but the instructions aren't there."*
- **How to apply**:
  - Write step-by-step instructions for: account creation, subscription plans, system requirements, and opening administrator privileges (Win+X → Terminal (Admin), UAC "Yes").
  - Separating into a standalone **pre-installation checklist** document keeps the main text lighter.

---

## 8. GitHub Pages Readability

**Principle**: All materials deployed as a static site must appear consistently in HTML.

- **Why**: Reviewer feedback — *"When viewing on GitHub Pages, other documents are HTML but the setup guide is md, which hurts readability. Is there a way to improve this?"*
- **How to apply**:
  - Provide learner-facing materials (`docs/`) in **`.html`** format, not `.md`.
  - Include a fixed left navigation, "Copy" buttons, and **site-wide search** (`site-search.js`).
  - Internal reference documents for authors (like this file) remain as repository-root Markdown.

---

## 9. OS-Specific Command Handling (Most Frequently Flagged Area)

**Principle**: **Split commands by OS only when they actually do not work due to OS characteristics. Otherwise, show a single example.**

- **Why**: Reviewer feedback — *"There are cases that work on macOS/Linux but not on Windows. Account for each OS situation."* + *"In PowerShell's case, utilities like cat, echo that are primarily used in macOS/Linux are provided."*
- **How to apply**:
  - **Single example is sufficient** (PowerShell supports as alias): `cat`, `echo`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `ls`, `mv`, `cd`, `>`/`>>` redirection — use one example without OS splitting.
  - **Real incompatibilities that require OS splitting**:
    - Bash heredoc syntax `<< 'EOF'` → PowerShell uses here-string `@'...'@` + `Set-Content`/`Add-Content`
    - Process substitution `<(...)` → PowerShell uses `Compare-Object`
    - OS-specific install scripts (`setup-mac.sh` / `setup-linux.sh` / `setup-windows.ps1`)
    - Path notation conventions (`~/git` vs `C:\git`)
  - **Expression accuracy**: Do not write "PowerShell cannot use `cat`" — write **"`cat` works, but `<< 'EOF'` heredoc syntax is not available."** Distinguish between what doesn't work (command vs. syntax).
  - **Path notation**: `~` (home directory) is auto-expanded by shells on macOS/Linux but **not supported in Windows CMD**. The `./` prefix also causes `mkdir` syntax errors in CMD. The safest approach is to use **just the folder name** without any prefix.
    Example: Not `mkdir ~/harness-lab` but `mkdir harness-lab` (works on macOS/Linux, PowerShell, and CMD).
  - **Prefer `mkdir -p`**: `mkdir -p` proceeds without error even if the target folder already exists, making it safe when learners re-run steps. Always use `mkdir -p` for folder creation commands.

---

## 10. Visual Aids

**Principle**: Place sufficient images or diagrams in each section to aid learner comprehension.

- **Why**: Reviewer feedback — *"Having appropriate images or diagrams in the document would greatly help understanding."*

### 10-1. Per-Section Visual Aid Placement Criteria

Every section (§) in every chapter must include at least one visual element. Types of visual elements:

- **Inline SVG diagrams** (architecture, flowcharts, pipelines, comparison structures)
- **CSS-based visual elements** (`.tree-box`, `.flow-box`, `.compare-grid`, `.stat-grid`, `.variant-list`)
- **HTML tables** (comparison tables, classification tables, matrices)
- **Code blocks** (hands-on sections only — code itself serves as visual structure)

| Section Type | Required Visual Element | Optional Visual Element |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Concept definition | SVG diagram or comparison table showing the concept at a glance | Analogy image |
| Flow/process | SVG flowchart or step-by-step pipeline diagram | CSS step table |
| Comparison/selection | CSS compare-grid or HTML comparison table | SVG comparison diagram |
| Hands-on exercise | flow-box (auto-performed) + prompt-box (user input) | SVG pipeline |
| Structure/architecture | SVG hierarchy diagram or `.tree-box` | File structure table |
| Summary/checklist | The checklist itself is a visual element | Completeness comparison table |

Exception: Reference/procedure documents such as glossaries, FAQs, and installation checklists are not required to have visual elements.

### 10-2. SVG Diagram Authoring Principles

- **No external image dependencies** — create all visual aids as inline SVG or CSS/HTML.
- **Dark mode compatible** — use CSS custom properties (`var(--text)`, `var(--border)`, etc.) or neutral colors.
- **Responsive** — set `viewBox` on SVG and use `width="100%"` so they scale with the window.
- **Consistent wrapper style** — all SVG containers use the same wrapper:
  `<div style="background:var(--bg2);border:1px solid var(--border);border-radius:10px;padding:20px;margin:20px 0 28px;">`
- **Text size** — use 11–13px (`font-size`) for text inside SVG; make labels bold.
- **Color palette** (maintain consistency):

  | Purpose | Color |
  |---------|-------|
  | Main text | `#1f2328` |
  | Secondary text | `#636c76` |
  | Accent (blue) | `#0969da` |
  | Success (green) | `#1a7f37` |
  | Warning (orange) | `#953800` |
  | Error (red) | `#cf222e` |
  | Secondary (purple) | `#6639ba` |
  | Background | `#f6f8fa` |
  | Border | `#d0d7de` |

### 10-3. Visual Aid Placement Example

Below is an actual applied placement example. For new courses, create a placement table using the same criteria (§10-1) adapted to the chapter structure.

| Chapter | Section | Minimum Visual Element | Form |
|---------|---------|----------------------|------|
| Ch.N §0 | Concept definition | Concept comparison table / analogy diagram | HTML table + SVG |
| Ch.N §1 | Flow/process | Step-by-step pipeline | SVG |
| Ch.N §2 | Hands-on | flow-box (auto-performed) + prompt-box | CSS + code |
| Ch.N §3 | Structure/architecture | Hierarchy diagram or tree-box | SVG + CSS |

### 10-4. Standard Named Component Classes

**Principle**: Reuse the following named CSS component conventions instead of inventing ad-hoc box styles. They are drawn from repeated patterns across the shipped chapters and are recognized as first-class visual elements under §10-1.

| Component | Classes | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Command reference chips | `.cmd-chips`, `.cmd-list`, `.cmd-list-title`, `.cmd-chip` | Quick-glance list of commands/flags, distinct from a `.code-block` (which shows a runnable sequence) |
| End-of-section recap | `.keypoints`, `.kp-title` | Bullet recap of what the section just taught |
| End-of-section quiz | `.quiz`, `.quiz-title` | Self-check questions placed at section end (pairs with §20-4 check questions for instructor use) |
| Index card type badges | `.tag-ref`, `.tag-ex`, `.tag-ch` | On `index.html` cards, distinguish reference material, hands-on exercises, and numbered chapters at a glance (extends §21-2) |
| Schedule/timing rows | `.schedule-block`, `.schedule-time`, `.schedule-body` | Renders the §20-1 time-allocation table as timeline rows in the Lecture Guide |
| Version/label rows | `.version-row`, `.vlabel`, `.vvalue` | Key–value rows for version/tooling info blocks (e.g., in Course Overview prerequisites) |

- **Why**: Without a named convention, each new chapter reinvents its own box markup for the same recurring content shapes (command lists, quizzes, recaps), causing visual drift across chapters.
- **How to apply**: When a section needs one of the above content shapes, reuse the matching class set rather than creating a new one. If a genuinely new recurring shape emerges in 3+ places, add it to this table rather than leaving it undocumented.

---

## 11. Markup Details

**Principle**: Avoid unnecessary line breaks caused by emphasizing a single word in the middle of a sentence, and prevent text boxes from protruding outside parent borders in nested flex layouts.

- **Why**: Reviewer feedback — *"Lines are broken unnecessarily."* (A case where a single Korean word in the middle of a sentence was wrapped in `<strong>`, causing the word to appear detached when rendered) / *"Text boxes extend outside the outer border and get clipped by the final border."* (A case where `.flow-box` etc. extended beyond `.platform-block` boundaries and was clipped by `.scenario-card`'s `overflow: hidden`)
- **How to apply**:
  - Group emphasis at **natural phrase-unit boundaries** (e.g., not `heredoc <strong>syntax</strong>` but the entire meaningful phrase, or remove the emphasis altogether).
  - Add `min-width: 0` to comparison boxes/grids so long lines do not push the box outward.

### 11-1. Preventing Text Box Overflow in Flex Layouts

The structure of hands-on pages is deeply nested: `.scenario-card` > `.card-body` > `.platform-block` > `ol.step-list` > `li` > `.step-content` > (`.flow-box` / `.tip-box` / `.warning-box`). Here `.step-list li` is a flex container and `.step-content` is a `flex: 1` child.

In CSS flex, **flex children's default `min-width` is `auto`**, so they cannot shrink below their content's intrinsic width. Long `<code>` inline elements inside text boxes (e.g., `<code>subagent_type="writer"</code>`) push `.step-content` outward, causing it to protrude beyond `.platform-block`'s border, and ultimately get clipped by `.scenario-card`'s `overflow: hidden`.

Additionally, `.platform-block` has its own padding (20px on each side), so text boxes inside it appear 40px narrower than those directly inside `.card-body`. Negative margin compensates for this.

**Required CSS rules** (include whenever a new HTML file uses the `step-list` structure):

| Selector | Property | Effect |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `.step-content` | `min-width: 0` | Allows flex children to shrink below their content's intrinsic width |
| `.flow-box`, `.tip-box`, `.warning-box` | `overflow-wrap: break-word` | Long inline elements wrap at box boundaries |
| `.platform-block .flow-box` etc. | `margin-left/right: -10px` | Compensates for text box narrowing caused by accumulated padding |

Application example:
```css
.step-content { flex: 1; min-width: 0; }
.flow-box {
  /* ... existing properties ... */
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
}
.platform-block .flow-box,
.platform-block .tip-box,
.platform-block .warning-box {
  margin-left: -10px;
  margin-right: -10px;
}
```

### 11-2. Preventing Line Breaks on Fixed Elements Inside Flex Containers

When placing a badge, title, and description side by side inside `.level-header` (`display: flex`), the default `flex-shrink: 1` can cause the badge and title to wrap to two lines when the window narrows.

**Rule**: Apply `flex-shrink: 0` to elements that **must never wrap** inside a flex container, and `flex: 1` to elements that **fill the remaining space**.

```css
.level-header .badge    { flex-shrink: 0; }
.level-header .level-title { flex-shrink: 0; }
.level-header .level-desc  { flex: 1; }
```

### 11-3. No Nested Interactive Elements (`<a>` Inside `<a>`)

**Rule**: Never place an `<a>` element inside another `<a>` element — most commonly, a card built as `<a class="card" href="...">` must not contain an inline `<a href="...">` in its description text.

- **Why**: Nested `<a>` tags are invalid HTML5. Per the parsing spec, the browser's parser implicitly closes the outer `<a>` as soon as it encounters the inner one — it does not error, it silently truncates. Everything in the card after the inline link (including the trailing "Open →" affordance) stops being part of the clickable card link. This bug produces no visible symptom in a static preview; it only shows up as "half the card doesn't respond to clicks" when actually used in a browser, so review by eye is not sufficient.
- **How to apply**:
  - If a card's description needs to reference an external resource (e.g., a prerequisite handbook, an upstream repo), write it as plain text — do not wrap it in `<a>`.
  - Put the actual link on the destination page instead (its own lead paragraph, footer, etc.), where it isn't nested inside another link.
  - When reviewing an existing card, search for `<a` inside the card's inner markup (between the opening `<a class="card"...>` and its matching `</a>`) — any hit is a bug, not a style choice.

### 11-4. `.table-schedule` Column-Width Convention

**Rule**: Only wrap a `<table>` in `.table-schedule` when every column from the 3rd onward holds **short, fixed vocabulary** (e.g., "Lecture", "10 min", "Y/N"). Do not use it for tables where a later column holds free-text prose (explanations, recommendations, notes).

- **Why**: `.table-schedule td:nth-child(n+3) { white-space: nowrap; }` exists specifically so short repeated values in schedule-style tables (`Category | Content | Format | Est. Time`) stay compact instead of wrapping awkwardly. If a table's 3rd+ column instead holds long sentences, the same rule forces that column to refuse wrapping, blowing the table out far wider than its container instead of laying out normally.
  - Only the 1st column gets an explicit width (`18ch`) with normal wrapping — it's sized for chapter labels that vary a lot in length across languages.
- **How to apply**:
  - Skip-map / comparison tables where a later column is a sentence-length recommendation or explanation should use a bare `<table>` (no wrapper div) — the base `table` rule (`table-layout: auto`, normal wrapping) already renders it correctly.
  - Reserve `.table-schedule` for tables shaped like the time-allocation tables in the Lecture Guide (§20): short category labels, short duration/format values.

---

## 12. Writing Style Consistency

**Principle**: Apply the same style standards across all chapters and sections so readers experience no jarring shifts when moving between chapters.

- **Why**: Different writing styles per chapter undermine consistency as teaching material. In the actual draft, polite form, English terminology notation, chapter reference format, and em-dash usage frequency all varied across files.
- **How to apply**:

### 12-1. Sentence Endings

Use the **formal plain register** for the document's language uniformly across all body text, subheadings, and descriptions. Polite register is only permitted in UI button labels and error messages (user-facing interaction elements).

| Language | Body text style | Disallowed style | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Korean | Plain form ("haera-che": `~da`/`~handa`/`~ida`) | Polite form (`~seumnida`/`~haeyo`) | Maintain didactic tone |
| Japanese | `da/dearu` form (plain form) | `desu/masu` form (polite form) | Academic style |
| English | Declarative (no contractions in prose) | Informal/casual | Academic technical prose |
| Spanish | Registro neutro/formal (usted) | Registro informal (tuteo/voseo) | Academic tone |

Each edition applies the register rules for its own language. See the Korean-language source (`AUTHORING_GUIDELINES.md` in the handbook repository) for language-specific examples.

### 12-2. English Technical Term Notation

When using English technical terms in body text, add a **parenthetical gloss only on first appearance within the document**, formatted as `local_term(English)` for non-English editions. On subsequent appearances within the same document, use the English term alone. Code, filenames, and CLI identifiers are marked with `<code>` tags; conceptual terms distinct from code use parenthetical glosses.

| Language | First-appearance gloss format | Example |
|----------|-------------------------------|---------|
| Korean | Korean(English) | e.g., `hookeul(hook)` |
| Japanese | Japanese(English) | e.g., `fukku(hook)` |
| English | *(no parenthetical — English-only)* | `hook` |
| Spanish | Spanish(English) *(if translated)* or English-only *(if untranslated)* | e.g., `enlace(hook)` / `hook` |

Note: The English edition requires no parenthetical glosses since English is the source language. For Spanish, conventionally-translated terms (hook→enlace, branch→rama) receive glosses; non-conventionalized terms remain English-only.

```
KO example (glossed correctly on first appearance, English alone after):
  [OK] "hookeul(hook) is called before and after shell command execution. ... In subsequent paragraphs,
        hook failure halts the commit."
  [NO]  "hook is called ..."  (first appearance without gloss)
  [NO]  "<code>hook</code> is called ..."  (conceptual term styled as code)
  [NO]  "... hookeul(hook) is called ..."  (continued glossing from second appearance onward)

EN edition: no glosses needed — "hook" appears as-is throughout.
```

This rule applies **per document (file)** — in a different document, the first appearance in that document becomes the new baseline (e.g., if a term was glossed in Chapter 4, it must be glossed again on first appearance in Chapter 8).

**Headings are exempt.** Text serving as headings — such as `<title>`, `<h1>`, `chapter-eyebrow`, and nav chapter titles — uses **English words only** without parenthetical glosses (and no monolingual labels in other languages either). This applies to all language editions.

| Language | Heading format | Example pattern |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Korean | Korean structure words + English technical terms | `<h1>structure-words + variant</h1>` |
| Japanese | Japanese structure words + English technical terms | `<h1>structure-words + variant</h1>` |
| English | English only | `<h1>Creating a New Variant</h1>` |
| Spanish | Spanish structure words + English technical terms | `<h1>structure-words + variant</h1>` |

Common rule: No parenthetical glosses in headings. Only English technical terms appear in heading text, combined with local-language structure words (articles, prepositions, etc.).

> **Exception — Korean-primary handbooks** (approved 2026-08-16): For handbooks whose **base/default edition is Korean** (`lang="ko"` base files with `_en` variants), the default edition may keep **fully Korean `<h1>` and `<title>` text** (e.g. `<h1>왜 AI 에이전트 팀인가?</h1>`). Rationale: a Korean-first handbook's primary audience reads Korean headings natively, and the `_en` variant provides the English-heading experience. This exception applies only to the default (Korean) edition; translated editions must use their own language consistently. When the default edition is not Korean, the English-only rule and the language table above apply unchanged.

### 12-3. Chapter/Section Reference Format

When referencing another chapter or section, unify the format as **`N장 §M`**.

```
✗ "5장에서 자세히 다룬다"
✗ "제5장에서 다룸"
✓ "5장 §3에서 다룬다"
```

### 12-3a. Glossary Entry Markup

**Principle**: Glossary entries use a fixed `<dl>`/`<dt>`/`<dd>` pattern that pairs the local-language term with the English term and back-links to where it is explained in depth.

```html
<dt>훅 <span class="en">hook</span></dt>
<dd>
  ... definition ...
  <span class="see">자세히: <a href="../concepts/....html#hooks">4장 §2</a></span>
</dd>
```

- **Why**: A uniform glossary structure lets `site-search.js` and the term-glossing rule in §12-2 point readers to one predictable place, and keeps the "first-use gloss, then English-only" rule (§12-2) consistent with how the glossary itself defines terms.
- **How to apply**: Every glossary `<dt>` pairs the local term with `<span class="en">English</span>`; every `<dd>` that has a fuller treatment elsewhere ends with `<span class="see">...</span>` using the §12-3 chapter/section reference format.

### 12-4. Minimize em-dash (—) Usage

Use em-dashes **minimally**, only where supplementary explanation is unavoidable. Shortening sentences usually eliminates the need for em-dashes in most cases. Especially avoid them in hands-on chapters.

```
✗ "좋은 하네스는 매번 잘 대답하게 만든다 — 그게 핵심 차이다"
✓ "좋은 하네스는 매번 잘 대답하게 만든다. 이것이 핵심 차이다."
```

## 13. Completeness and Balance of Tool Comparisons

**Principle**: Comparison tables must not cause misunderstanding, must not omit items, and must be visually balanced.

- **Why**: Reviewer feedback — (a) *"Writing `/goal`, `/agent`, `/agents` makes it seem like other tools don't have them or they're Antigravity-only."*, (b) *"Message passing during subagent invocation and inter-subagent communication are missing."*, (c) *"Comparison box size balance is off."*
- **How to apply**:
  - Do not write something as if it exists in only one tool (mark common capabilities as "Common").
  - Define comparison dimensions (invocation · parallelization · isolation · messaging · communication) and **fill them in completely for every tool**.
  - Use the same grid rules and padding for columns/boxes to equalize heights.

---

## 14. Mandatory Course Overview

**Principle**: When generating course materials (workshop, course, seminar, etc.), **always include a Course Overview first**. Never create body text or exercises before the overview.

- **Why**: The Course Overview is the starting point for all external communications — participant recruitment, course announcements, operational approvals. Without an overview, every time someone asks "what is this course about?" you must search through the body text. Additionally, writing body text without clearly defined learning objectives leads to arbitrary scope and depth.
- **How to apply**:
  - During the course planning stage (before drafting), **write the Course Overview first**, then use its content as the basis for structuring the body. Verify that the learning objectives in the overview map 1:1 to actual body sections.
  - The Course Overview must include **all** of the following items (none may be omitted):

    | Item | Content | Notes |
    |------|---------|-------|
    | One-line summary | What this course is, in 2–3 sentences | Participant grasps it in 10 seconds |
    | Learning objectives | What participants can do after completion (Bloom's Taxonomy based) | Start with verbs: explain, design, apply, execute, compare, evaluate, implement, synthesize |
    | Target audience | Who this course is suitable for | Specify by role and experience level |
    | Prerequisites | What must be prepared before the course | Subscriptions, accounts, installations, knowledge level |
    | Format | Lecture / hands-on / discussion / demo ratio | Lets participants set expectations |
    | Schedule | Time-block schedule including breaks | State total duration with breaks |
    | Topics covered | Per-block topic with chapter/section mapping | Cross-validate with schedule |
    | Post-completion outcomes | Practical deliverables and skills immediately applicable | Provides participant motivation |
    | Instructor information | Instructor name, affiliation, profile (blanks allowed) | Designed for instructor to fill in |

  - Place the Course Overview file at `docs/lecture-guide/00_Course_Overview.html` (or the path matching the project's conventions), and link it as a card at the top of the instructor materials group on the index page (`docs/index.html`).
  - Whenever modifying body text or the time allocation table, **verify that the Course Overview's schedule, topics, and learning objectives remain consistent** and synchronize.

## 15. Chapter Connectivity and Table of Contents Review

**Principle**: Each chapter should flow smoothly into the next, and reviewing the overall table of contents should surface any gaps.

- **Why**: Reviewer feedback — *"Also check whether each chapter is well connected to the next."*, *"Review the table of contents and suggest areas that need supplementing or adding."*
- **How to apply**:
  - Add a transition bridge at the end of each chapter: "The next chapter covers ~."
  - During table of contents review, check that **supplementary materials (glossary, guardrails, FAQ, capstone, lecture guide)** are not missing.

### 15-1. Closing Trajectory of the Last Chapter

**Principle**: The last chapter (capstone, etc.) does not simply end because there is no "next chapter →" link — present **post-completion next steps** as a separate section.

- **Why**: Middle chapters naturally flow into "the next chapter covers ~," but the last chapter lacks that mechanism, so learners can easily finish with the unanswered question "so what do I do now?"
- **How to apply**:
  - Add a `Next Steps` section (`<h2 id="next-steps">`) to the last chapter and present concrete actions in checklist form — e.g., "apply to actual work", "consider promoting to a formal variant", "return to glossary/FAQ if stuck."
  - The `chapter-nav` `next` link has no body chapter to point to, so link to reference materials like the glossary or FAQ instead — but label it `Reference →` rather than `Next chapter →` to indicate the different nature.

---

## 16. Language Policy

- Course body text, hands-on instructions, and UI copy are written in **the course's primary language** (e.g., Korean for Korean-language educational materials). Each translated edition uses its own language (KO/JA/EN/ES respectively).
- However, **code comments, identifiers, commit messages, PR titles/bodies, and branch names** are always in English across all language editions.
- File names follow English kebab/snake case conventions (common to all language editions).

---

## 17. Video References

**Principle**: When official video resources exist that supplement a section's content, provide links in a "Video References" section.

- **Why**: Video content explaining the same concept visually greatly enhances learner comprehension. Especially for dynamic content like orchestration patterns, agent behavior flows, and tool demos, text and diagrams alone may be insufficient.

### 17-1. Video Selection Criteria

- **Official sources preferred**: Anthropic, Google DeepMind, DeepLearning.AI, and other official channels take priority.
- **Language**: In each translated edition, prioritize videos in that edition's language first (e.g., Korean videos for the KO edition, Japanese videos for the JA edition, Spanish videos for the ES edition). If no suitable video exists in the target language, include EN videos as common content. Use `video-badge` to indicate the language of each video.
- **Length**: Prefer videos under 20 minutes. Provide timestamps for longer videos.
- **Recency**: Prefer videos published within the last 2 years.
- **Free access**: Only link videos published on platforms anyone can access (YouTube, etc.).
- **Channel trustworthiness**: Use YouTube oEmbed API (`youtube.com/oembed`) to verify video existence and channel information. Trustworthiness criteria:
  - **TRUSTWORTHY**: Official channels (Anthropic, Google, etc.), or channels with 10,000+ subscribers, or videos with 10,000+ views
  - **QUESTIONABLE**: Does not meet subscriber/view thresholds but content is relevant — review and find alternative or remove
  - **BROKEN**: oEmbed 404 response (deleted/private/invalid ID) — remove immediately
  - Official channels (Anthropic, Google, etc.) are TRUSTWORTHY regardless of subscriber count

### 17-2. Video Link Placement

Videos are not embedded directly (`<iframe>`); instead, provide them as links in a "Video References" block at the end of a section or chapter. Reasons: (a) embedding slows page loading, (b) external platform policy changes can break embeds, and (c) learners may prefer watching in their own environment.

HTML pattern:
```html
<div class="video-refs">
  <h3 id="videos">Video References</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="video-badge en">EN</span>
      <a href="YOUTUBE_URL" target="_blank">Video Title</a>
      <span class="video-meta">(MM:SS)</span> — One-line description
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

CSS:
```css
.video-refs {
  margin: 28px 0;
  padding: 16px 20px;
  background: var(--bg-info);
  border: 1px solid var(--border-info);
  border-radius: 8px;
}
.video-refs h3 {
  font-size: 15px;
  font-weight: 700;
  color: var(--accent);
  margin: 0 0 12px;
}
.video-refs ul { list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0; }
.video-refs li { padding: 6px 0; line-height: 1.6; }
.video-badge {
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 11px;
  font-weight: 700;
  padding: 1px 6px;
  border-radius: 3px;
  color: var(--text-inverse);
  vertical-align: middle;
  margin-right: 6px;
}
.video-badge.en { background: var(--accent); }
.video-badge.ko { background: var(--accent-green); }
.video-badge.ja { background: var(--accent-red); }
.video-badge.es { background: var(--accent-amber); }
.video-meta { font-size: 12px; color: var(--text-dim); }
```

### 17-3. Sections Where Video References Are Recommended

Below is an applied placement example. For new courses, judge using the same criteria (§17-1) adapted to the chapter structure.

| Chapter/Section | Recommended Video Topic | Expected Source |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Introductory chapter | Field overview, historical context | Official education channels |
| Core concept chapter | Orchestration/pipeline visualization, dynamic content | Official documentation channels |
| Guardrails/security chapter | Security, permission control concepts | Security-related official channels |
| Hands-on chapter | Actual tool operation demo | Official tutorial channels |
| Comparison chapter | Tool comparison, per-platform differences | Each platform's official channels |

Verify video URLs at time of writing and reflect them. Do not force-add videos to sections where no official video exists.

### 17-4. Video Trust Verification Procedure

All videos included in the handbook should be periodically verified — or batch-verified when videos are added or modified in bulk. Verification proceeds in 5 stages.

#### Stage 1: Existence Check (oEmbed)

Query all videos against the YouTube oEmbed API to confirm public availability.

```
GET https://www.youtube.com/oembed?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={VIDEO_ID}&format=json
```

| Response | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| HTTP 200 + JSON body | Public video, metadata available | Proceed to Stage 2 |
| HTTP 404 | Deleted / private / invalid ID | **BROKEN** verdict — remove immediately |

Extract from the oEmbed response:
- `title` — actual video title
- `author_name` — channel name
- `author_url` — channel URL (includes `@handle`)
- `thumbnail_url` — thumbnail (for existence confirmation)

#### Stage 2: Metadata Match Check

Compare oEmbed metadata with handbook records.

| Check field | Comparison target | Mismatch action |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Title** | oEmbed `title` vs HTML `<a>` text | Correct to oEmbed original title. If HTML contains a translated title, restore to the actual language's original title |
| **Channel name** | oEmbed `author_name` vs source notation in the section | Correct to actual channel name if mismatched |
| **Badge language** | `video-badge` class (en/ko/ja/es) vs video's actual language | Correct to proper language badge (e.g., English video with `ko` badge → change to `en`) |
| **Typos** | Title and description spelling | Correct to proper spelling |

> **Real example**: During a prior verification, 2 English videos were found with incorrect `video-badge ko` badges — corrected to `en`. Additionally, 3 Korean titles contained typos that were fixed.

#### Stage 3: Content Relevance Check

Verify that each video topic aligns with its section. Criteria:
- Video topic must be directly related to the concept covered in the section
- Tutorial videos must match the hands-on content and tools
- Comparison videos must cover the tools/platforms compared in the handbook

Non-matching videos receive **QUESTIONABLE** verdict.

#### Stage 4: Channel Trustworthiness Evaluation

Evaluate channels of videos that passed stages 1–3 using the following criteria.

| Verdict | Criteria |
|---------|----------|
| **TRUSTWORTHY** | Meets one of: (a) official channel (Anthropic, Google, etc.), (b) 10,000+ subscribers, (c) 10,000+ views on the specific video |
| **QUESTIONABLE** | Does not meet (a)–(c) but content is relevant |

Subscriber/view counts can be verified via YouTube search results, channel pages, or third-party tools. Since YouTube pages require JavaScript rendering, oEmbed + web search results serve as supplementary verification methods.

#### Stage 5: Action and Follow-up

Take action based on verification results.

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **BROKEN** | Delete the `<li>` item from the HTML |
| **TRUSTWORTHY** | Keep (apply metadata fixes discovered in Stage 2) |
| **QUESTIONABLE** | Search for a trustworthy alternative video in the same language. The replacement must also satisfy §17-1 criteria and undergo the same 5-stage verification. If no replacement found, delete the item. If another language's TRUSTWORTHY video already exists for the same section, deletion takes priority |

#### Verification Execution Guide

- For batch verification, run language-specific agents in parallel (KO / EN / JA / ES independently)
- After verification, commit all corrections in a single commit for consistency
- Record verification results in table format by section and language

## 18. Platform-Specific Separation (A/B Branching)

**Principle**: When a section covers the same concept implemented differently by the Claude family and the Antigravity family, separate it into common and tool-specific areas.

- **Why**: Putting both families' implementations in one file means (a) users must skip content irrelevant to their tool, (b) the file becomes excessively long, and (c) updates to one side risk misaligning with the other.
- **How to apply**:

### 18-1. Separation Criteria

| Condition | Split? |
|-----------|--------|
| Code/commands differ per platform | Split |
| UI operation steps differ per platform | Split |
| Supported features themselves differ (supported/unsupported) | Split |
| Concept explanations, specification comparison tables | Keep unified |
| Summaries, reference links | Keep unified |

### 18-2. Naming Conventions

| Element | A (Claude) | B (Antigravity) |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Filename | `_Examples.html` (no suffix) | `_Examples_B.html` |
| Section label | `§N-A` | `§N-B` |
| Color | Green `#1a7f37` | Purple `#6639ba` |
| badge class | `badge-claude`, `badge-claudeapp` | `badge-antigravity`, `badge-agy` |

### 18-3. 3-Link Branch Navigation (Common → Tool-Specific)

At the bottom of the common area (reference file), place a `prev | branch(A, B) | next` 3-link pattern navigation that branches to tool-specific files.

HTML template:
```html
<div class="chapter-nav">
  <a href="previous_chapter.html" class="prev">
    <div class="dir">&larr; Prev</div><div class="ttl">Ch.N &middot; Title</div>
  </a>
  <div class="branch">
    <div class="branch-label">Ch.N Exercises</div>
    <a href="Examples.html" style="border-color:#1a7f37;color:#1a7f37;">Claude (A)</a>
    <a href="Examples_B.html" style="border-color:#6639ba;color:#6639ba;">Antigravity (B)</a>
  </div>
  <a href="next_chapter.html" class="next">
    <div class="dir">Next &rarr;</div><div class="ttl">Ch.N &middot; Title</div>
  </a>
</div>
```

CSS (add to file as needed):
```css
.chapter-nav .branch { flex: 0 0 auto; text-align: center; min-width: 120px; }
.chapter-nav .branch a { display: block; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 6px; padding: 10px 14px; }
.chapter-nav .branch-label { font-size: 10px; color: var(--text-dim); margin-bottom: 6px; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .05em; }
```

### 18-4. 2-Link Chain Navigation (A↔B Sequential)

A/B files are linked to each other sequentially via prev/next links.

- **Bottom of A file**: `&larr; §N Common Area` | `§N-B Antigravity Focus &rarr;`
- **Bottom of B file**: `§N-A Claude Focus &rarr;` | `Next Chapter &rarr;`

### 18-5. platform-pair / platform-block Rules

- **`.platform-pair`**: 2-column comparison grid — used only in common reference files. Used when comparing 4 tools side by side (e.g., Chapter 4 §1 reference).
- **`.platform-block`**: Single-platform command block — in A/B split files, show only the relevant platform's block. Remove the opposite platform's block.
- **4-tool classification**: Claude Desktop App, Claude Code (CLI), Antigravity (Desktop), Antigravity CLI (agy).

### 18-6. A/B Split Checklist

After splitting is complete, verify the following:

- [ ] Does branch navigation connect from the common area to both A and B?
- [ ] Are inter-links between A and B files consistent?
- [ ] Does the A file contain only Claude family content, and the B file only Antigravity family content?
- [ ] Are A and B cards placed side by side on `index.html`?

## 19. Proofreading Before Finalization

**Principle**: AI-generated drafts must always be fully re-read by a human to correct typos, awkward phrasing, and number mismatches.

- **Why**: AI-generated drafts may contain spelling errors, contextually inappropriate expressions, and chapter/section number mismatches. No matter how structurally complete the materials are, many typos undermine credibility.
- **How to apply**:
  - After writing chapter/section files, **read the entire chapter from start to finish** checking for:
    - Typos (spelling, spacing)
    - Contextually inappropriate expressions (literal translations, awkward translated phrasing)
    - Chapter/section number mismatches (incorrect numbers when referencing other chapters)
    - Logical disconnection between sentences (causal relationships reversed, etc.)
  - Proofreading is performed as the **final step** of the §A checklist.
  - Instructor-facing resources (lecture guide, course overview) are subject to the same review.

---

## 20. Lecture / Instructor Guide Structure

**Principle**: The Lecture Guide (also called Instructor Guide — `instructor-guide.html`) provides instructors with all the information needed to run the course, consolidated in one place. Together with the Course Overview principle (§14), these form the two pillars of course materials.

- **Why**: Instructors must navigate content across multiple chapters, so per-chapter instructor notes, time allocation tables, and check questions must be gathered in a single document for real-time reference. Additionally, the Course Overview (for participants) and the Lecture Guide (for instructors) must be consistent in content, order, and timing.
- **How to apply**:

### 20-1. Required Sections

The Lecture Guide must include **all** of the following sections.

| Section | Content | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Pre-course preparation checklist | What participants must prepare before the course | Announce at least one day before the course |
| Time allocation table | Daily/chapter breakdown, format, estimated time | Breaks calculated separately |
| Per-chapter instructor notes | Tips, participant activities, demo notes per chapter | Include time-short alternatives for when time is short |
| Per-chapter check questions | Comprehension questions to ask at the end of each chapter | Designed to elicit explanations, not guess correct answers |
| Demo sequence | Recommended order for live demonstrations | Reflect inter-chapter dependencies |
| Evaluation criteria | Rubrics for participant assessment | Focused on practical application ability |

### 20-2. Per-Chapter Instructor Notes Format

Each chapter's instructor notes should include:

- **Position and role**: Where this chapter falls in the overall course, and why it is in this order
- **Key delivery points**: Concepts that must be delivered (the rest can be omitted if time is short)
- **Participant activities**: Discussions, polls, pair activities — things participants do directly
- **Time-short alternatives**: Which parts can be replaced with demos when time is insufficient
- **Irreversible operation warnings**: Operations that affect the environment irreversibly — things all participants should not do simultaneously

### 20-3. Check Question Format

- Write **2–3** open-ended questions per chapter.
- Compose questions that invite participants to **"explain in their own words"** rather than "guess the right answer."
- Including questions that connect core concepts from this chapter to other chapters promotes integrated understanding.
- Examples:
  - "How could this concept be applied to our team's work?" (practical application)
  - "What is the difference between ~ covered in Chapter N and ~ in this chapter?" (inter-chapter connection)

### 20-4. Consistency with Course Overview

The Lecture Guide must be **consistent** with the Course Overview in §14 for the following items:

- Daily course order (chapter placement)
- Per-chapter estimated time
- Per-chapter content description
- Total duration

When one side is modified, the other must always be synchronized.

---

## 21. Navigation and Index Structure

**Principle**: Apply consistent navigation structure across all HTML files so learners can move between chapters and sections naturally, and design the index page so the overall structure is visible at a glance.

- **Why**: When the number of chapters exceeds 10, learners find it difficult to track "where am I now, and what's next." Without sidebars, inter-chapter links, and index cards, the learning flow is interrupted.
- **How to apply**:

### 21-1. Intra-Chapter Navigation

Every chapter HTML file must include the following navigation elements:

- **Sidebar (nav)**: Fixed on the left. Contains links to sections (`#id`) within the chapter and a "Handbook Home" link.
- **Chapter navigation (chapter-nav)**: Place `&larr; Previous Chapter | Next Chapter &rarr;` links at the bottom of the chapter.
- **Chapters with A/B splits**: Apply the 3-link branch navigation or 2-link chain navigation per §18.

### 21-2. Index Page (index.html)

The index is the entry point for the entire handbook. Include the following structure:

- **Course title and one-line description**: Placed at the top.
- **Grouping by day and type**: Group chapter cards by course day (e.g., Day 1 / Day 2) and type (concept / hands-on).
- **Chapter cards**: Each card includes the chapter title, 1–2 line description, chapter number tag, and link. Concept chapters and hands-on chapters should be visually distinguishable using the `.tag-ref` (reference material) / `.tag-ex` (hands-on exercise) / `.tag-ch` (numbered chapter) badge classes from §10-4.
- **Instructor materials group**: Course Overview, Lecture Guide, and other instructor-only resources are placed in a separate group.

### 21-3. Consistency

- All chapter files use the same HTML template structure (layout, nav, main, article).
- The "Handbook Home" link in the sidebar points to the same path (`../index.html` or `./index.html`) across all files.
- Chapter numbers, tag colors, and link styles are applied consistently between chapter files and index cards.

### 21-4. Renumbering Integrity Verification

**Principle**: When adding, deleting, or reordering chapters — or adding any standalone new page (a prerequisite guide, appendix, setup page, etc.) — **do not stop at merely moving/creating files** — update and verify all five of the following without exception. These are the points most frequently missed.

- **Why**: During an actual chapter reordering: ① `chapter-nav` prev/next did not reflect the new order, creating links that skip or loop backward; ② links pointed to new files but label text retained old chapter numbers; ③ newly created files were not added to `site-search.js`'s `DOCS` array, causing them to be missed in full-site search. Separately, adding a standalone new page (not a renumbering) has its own recurring failure mode: ④ the page gets created and linked from one place, but its running-text prose still cross-references chapter numbers by the wrong number (e.g. body text says "see Chapter 5" for content that's actually Chapter 6) — this isn't caught by link-label checks because it's plain text, not a link, and it isn't caught by skimming since the number "looks right" out of context.
- **How to apply**:
  1. **prev/next mutual symmetry** — If document A's `next` points to B, then B's `prev` must point to A. Fixing only one side and missing the other creates a link that works in one direction ("next") but not the other ("previous").
  2. **Link label and target consistency** — The label text (chapter number, title) in `<a href="...">label</a>` must always match the current chapter number and title of the file that `href` actually points to. When moving files, a common mistake is to update only `href` while leaving the label text as the copied old text.
  3. **Search index synchronization** — When adding new chapter files, or any standalone new page, add/update entries in the `DOCS` array in `docs/assets/site-search.js` **for every language variant of the page**, not just the base language. Do not omit warmup exercises that have no chapter number.
  4. **Sidebar "Other chapters" list** — Also update the "Other chapters" sidebar list in all affected chapters and the card order/tag numbers on `index.html`.
  5. **Body-text chapter cross-references** — Grep the new or changed page for every chapter-number mention in running prose (not just `<a>` labels — e.g. Korean `N장`, English `Chapter N`) and check each one against the actual current chapter list on `index.html`. Do this even for content that isn't part of a renumbering; a page written once and never touched again can still get its own internal cross-references wrong from the start, or drift out of sync as other chapters are renumbered around it later.
  - **Verification method**: Use the following script to mechanically check for ① broken links and ② prev/next asymmetry (runs against all HTML files under `docs/`).

    ```
    # (1) Broken links: does the file that href points to actually exist?
    # (2) prev/next asymmetry: A→next→B but B→prev is not A
    # Both can be checked with a single script run — recommended on every renumbering PR
    ```

    The `scripts/validate-nav.ts` automated verification script checks all four items in CI (`bun run scripts/validate-nav.ts`).

### 21-5. `<meta name="description">` Template

**Principle**: Every chapter file's `<meta name="description">` follows a fixed template rather than free-form summary text:

```
"Chapter N · Title - part of the Multi-Agent Team Harness Engineering Handbook."
```

localized per language edition (e.g., the KO/JA/ES editions translate "Chapter N · Title" and the trailing clause, not just insert raw English).

- **Why**: A consistent description template keeps search-engine snippets and social previews predictable across dozens of chapter files, and avoids each chapter re-deriving its own summary wording.
- **How to apply**: When authoring a new chapter file, set the meta description to `<course/handbook name> — Chapter N · <Title>` (or the equivalent localized phrasing), not a bespoke paragraph.

### 21-6. Footer Structure

**Principle**: Every page's `<footer>` follows a fixed 3-line structure, not free-form colophon text:

1. **Baseline line** — supported tool versions / `ai-workspace-standards main (<YYYY-MM-DD>)` baseline date · `<language> educational material` label
2. **Official resources line** — links to each supported tool's official docs, followed by the source repo link
3. **License line** — the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 statement, with the language-appropriate license deed URL (`.../deed.ko` for Korean, base URL for English)

```html
<footer>
  Claude Code 2026-07 / Antigravity CLI 1.1.0+ / Antigravity 2.0 / ai-workspace-standards main (2026-08-15) 기준 · 한국어 교육 자료<br>
  공식 자료: <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview" target="_blank">Claude Code</a> ·
  <a href="https://antigravity.google/docs/home" target="_blank">Antigravity</a> ·
  <a href="https://github.com/5throck/ai-workspace-standards" target="_blank">ai-workspace-standards</a><br>
  본 핸드북의 콘텐츠는 <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.ko" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (저작자표시-비영리-동일조건변경허락 4.0 국제)</a> 라이선스에 따라 이용할 수 있습니다.
</footer>
```

- **Why**: A footer that lists only the tools this specific handbook actually supports (not a generic "Claude" link) sets accurate reader expectations, and a dated baseline lets readers judge whether the content might be stale relative to the tools it documents.
- **How to apply**:
  - The tool list in line 1 and the official-docs links in line 2 must match the handbook's actual declared platform support (§3) — do not list a tool the handbook doesn't cover, and do not omit one it does.
  - The baseline date advances whenever a content or terminology sync pass is done (see §19); it is not the file's creation date.
  - This structure is identical across every page of a handbook (chapters, index, glossary, FAQ, lecture guide) — only the tool list, baseline date, and language wording vary.

---

## 22. Dark Mode Authoring

**Principle**: Define all colors as CSS custom properties (CSS variables), and never use hardcoded hex values. Dark mode follows a 3-layer structure.

- **Why**: Users on system dark mode, manual toggle, and light mode must all see the same content consistently. Hardcoded colors compromise readability in dark mode.

### 22-1. 3-Layer Dark Mode Structure

| Layer | Selector | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 (base) | `:root` | Light mode defaults |
| 2 (auto) | `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` | Auto-detect OS/browser setting |
| 3 (manual) | `.dark` | User toggle (stored in localStorage) |

### 22-2. Required CSS Variables

All colors used in HTML files must be referenced only through these CSS variables.
Variables are defined in `assets/css/handbook-variables.css` (theme file, overwritten by `apply-handbook-theme.ts`);
structural rules live in `assets/css/handbook-components.css` (never overwritten).

**Semantic accent names (preferred):**

```css
:root {
  /* Backgrounds & text */
  --bg: #ffffff;       --bg2: #f6f8fa;     --bg3: #eef1f4;
  --border: #d0d7de;   --text: #1f2328;    --text-dim: #636c76;
  --text-inverse: #fff;

  /* Accent palette */
  --accent: #0969da;
  --accent-green: #1a7f37;  --accent-purple: #6639ba;
  --accent-dark: #0550ae;   --accent-amber: #953800;   --accent-red: #cf222e;

  /* Semantic callout backgrounds & borders */
  --bg-info: #ddf4ff;  --bg-note: #fff8c5;  --bg-warn: #fff1c5;
  --bg-success: #dafbe1; --bg-error: #ffebe9;
  --border-info: #0969da; --border-note: #9a6700;
  --border-warn: #9a6700; --border-success: #1a7f37; --border-error: #cf222e;

  /* Code blocks & tags */
  --code-bg: #f6f8fa;  --code-border: #d0d7de;
  --tag-bg: #ddf4ff;   --tag-text: #0550ae;

  /* Platform colors (Claude, Claude Desktop App, AGY, Antigravity) */
  --platform-claude: #d97706;   --platform-claudeapp: #f59e0b;
  --platform-agy: #0550ae;      --platform-antigravity: #6639ba;

  /* Badge palettes (bg/fg/border per color) */
  --badge-green-bg/fg/border;   --badge-blue-bg/fg/border;
  --badge-purple-bg/fg/border;  --badge-amber-bg/fg/border;
  --badge-orange-bg/fg/border;  --badge-indigo-bg/fg/border;
  --badge-violet-bg/fg/border;  --badge-red-bg/fg;
  --badge-lab-bg/fg/border;

  /* Compare boxes & situation/video */
  --compare-without-bg/border;  --compare-with-bg/border;
  --bg-situation;  --border-situation;
  --bg-video;      --border-video;
}
```

**Backward-compatible aliases** (legacy files still work):
- `--accent2` → `var(--accent-green)`
- `--accent3` → `var(--accent-amber)`
- `--accent4` → `var(--accent-purple)`
- `--accent5` → `var(--accent-red)`
- `--accent6` → `var(--accent-dark)`

### 22-3. Prohibitions

- No inline `style="color: #0969da"` — always use CSS variables
- No hardcoded hex in CSS files (except in the variable definition block)
- No hardcoded colors in SVG — use `currentColor` or CSS variables

### 22-4. Transition Effects

Apply smooth transitions to all color changes:
```css
body, header, main, footer, nav, .sidebar {
  transition: background-color 0.2s, color 0.2s;
}
```

## 23. Multi-Language File Convention

**Principle**: Multi-language support uses separate HTML files following an AI-friendly filename pattern.

- **Why**: Mixing multiple languages in a single HTML file makes search indexing, translation management, and CMS integration difficult. Separate files allow independent management and search engine optimization per language.

### 23-1. Filename Pattern

| Language | Suffix | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Korean (default) | *(none)* | `01_Why_AI_Chapter.html` |
| Korean (explicit) | `_ko` | `A_Appendix_ko.html` |
| English | `_en` | `01_Why_AI_Chapter_en.html` |
| Japanese | `_ja` | `01_Why_AI_Chapter_ja.html` |
| Spanish | `_es` | `01_Why_AI_Chapter_es.html` |

Index pages follow the same pattern: `index.html` / `index_en.html` / `index_ja.html` / `index_es.html`.

**Explicit `_ko` suffix**: When a handbook has no unsuffixed default file for a given piece of content (every language ships as an explicit suffixed pair, e.g. an appendix added after the base chapters were already using the unsuffixed-Korean convention), use `_ko` explicitly rather than leaving Korean unsuffixed inconsistently with its siblings — e.g. `A_Remote_Access_ko.html` / `A_Remote_Access_en.html`. Language-switcher tooling and authoring-compliance checkers must treat `_ko` as a valid Korean variant, not only the unsuffixed default.

### 23-2. Page Structure Requirements

Translated files must be **complete copies** of the original. Each file must include:
- `<html lang="en">`, `<html lang="ja">`, or `<html lang="es">` attribute
- Its own sidebar navigation (linking to other files in the same language)
- `<script src="../assets/lang-switcher.js">` included
- Code blocks, file paths, URLs, and technical identifiers must NOT be translated

### 23-3. Translate vs. Do Not Translate

**Translate:** Titles, h1, body text, sidebar labels, meta description, card descriptions, note/warning box text
**Do NOT translate:** Code block contents, file/directory paths, CLI commands, URLs, CSS class names, technical identifiers (orchestrator, handoff contract, etc.), text inside SVG diagrams

### 23-4. Search Index

The `DOCS` array in `site-search.js` includes entries for all language variants. Add entries as each translation is completed — do not batch:
```javascript
{ path: 'intro/01_Why_AI_Chapter_en.html', title: 'Ch.1 · Business Innovation in the AI Era', lang: 'en' },
```

### 23-5. Verification

Run `bun run scripts/validate-nav.ts` to automatically verify link integrity. Translation completeness across language sets (KO/EN/JA/ES for each chapter) must be verified manually.

### 23-6. No Links to Untranslated Pages

**Principle**: Never add an `_en`/`_ja` link (in an index page, nav, or sidebar) until the target `_en.html`/`_ja.html` file actually exists.

- **Why**: A prior handbook shipped translated `index_en.html`/`index_ja.html` landing pages that linked to ~28 chapter pages before those chapters were translated. `check-links.ts` had a hardcoded exemption that skipped any missing `_en.html`/`_ja.html` target, so CI reported "PASS" while every translated chapter link 404'd.
- **Rule**: `check-links.ts` treats missing `_en.html`/`_ja.html` targets as errors like any other broken link — do not reintroduce an exemption for them. Translate a language track chapter-by-chapter (or hold the index/nav links for that language until the full set of pages exists); never publish a language's landing page ahead of its content pages.

### 23-7. Partial Translation Navigation

**Principle**: When some pages in a language track are untranslated, navigation MUST remain consistent within the existing set.

- **Why**: A handbook may grow chapter-by-chapter across languages. Users navigating a partially-translated language track must never encounter broken links or dead-end navigation.

- **Sidebar rule**: Every translated page's sidebar lists ONLY pages that exist in that language. Do NOT link to untranslated pages.

- **Chapter-nav rule**: If prev/next target is untranslated, link to the default-language version instead, with a visual indicator (e.g., "(KO)" badge).

- **DOCS array rule**: Add entries to site-search.js DOCS array as each translation is completed. Do not batch — each commit that adds a translated file must also add its DOCS entry.

- **Index page rule**: Card links in index pages must only point to existing translated files. Hide cards for untranslated chapters or show them grayed out with "Coming soon" label.
