## Context

This skill is a registration stub for the meeting-facilitation capability. The actual implementation resides in `.claude/commands/meeting.md` and `.gemini/commands/meeting.md`. This file exists to make the skill discoverable via `.agents/skills.json` at Priority 1.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when the user requests:
- `/meeting "topic"` — structured multi-agent discussion
- Facilitating collaborative decision-making across specialist agents
- Coordinating agent discussions for design reviews, problem-solving, or planning

## Execution Steps

This skill delegates entirely to the platform-specific command files:
1. **Claude Code**: `.claude/commands/meeting.md` handles the full facilitation flow
2. **Gemini CLI**: `.gemini/commands/meeting.md` handles the full facilitation flow
3. Both implementations support: agenda setting, round-robin dialogue, outcome synthesis, and transcript logging to `memory/meeting-YYYY-MM-DD-[slug].md`

## Output Format

Meeting transcript written to `memory/meeting-YYYY-MM-DD-[slug].md` containing:
- Agenda and objectives
- Per-agent contributions (round-by-round)
- Synthesized outcomes and decisions
- Action items with owner assignments

## Governance Rules

All meetings facilitated through this skill MUST uphold three invariants:
1. **Dissent seat**: at least one participant is designated as a red-team / dissenting role whose duty is to challenge the emerging consensus.
2. **PROPOSAL, never decision**: the synthesized outcome is a proposal for the user's approval — the meeting itself does not decide.
3. **Dissent preserved verbatim**: recorded disagreements are transcribed as stated — never summarized away or averaged into consensus.
