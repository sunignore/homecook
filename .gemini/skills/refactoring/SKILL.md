## Execution Steps

## Step 1: Refactoring Preparation

**Purpose**: Ensure safe refactoring environment.

**Preparation Checklist**:
1. **Test Coverage**:
   - [ ] Tests exist for code being refactored
   - [ ] Tests cover main functionality
   - [ ] Tests are currently passing
   - [ ] Tests can be run quickly

2. **Baseline Understanding**:
   - [ ] Code purpose and behavior understood
   - [ ] Current design issues identified
   - [ ] Refactoring goals defined
   - [ ] Success criteria established

3. **Safety Measures**:
   - [ ] Version control committed

   - [ ] Tests run before starting

**Refactoring Goals**:
- Remove duplication
- Improve names and clarity
- Simplify complex logic
- Apply design patterns
- Reduce coupling
- Increase cohesion

---

## Step 2: Identify Code Smells

**Purpose**: Find specific refactoring opportunities.

**Common Code Smells**:
1. **Duplication**:
   - Duplicated code blocks
   - Similar logic in multiple places
   - Copy-pasted implementations

2. **Long Methods**:
   - Functions doing too many things
   - Methods that are hard to understand
   - Complex nested logic

3. **Large Classes**:
   - Classes with too many responsibilities
   - God objects doing everything
   - Classes with many dependencies

4. **Poor Names**:
   - Unclear variable/function names
   - Abbreviations that aren't obvious
   - Misleading names

5. **Complex Conditionals**:
   - Deep nesting
   - Complex boolean expressions
   - Multiple guard clauses

**Detection Techniques**:
- Code review with checklist
- Static analysis tools (linters, SonarQube)
- Cyclomatic complexity analysis
- Duplicate code detection

**Prioritization**:
- High impact, low risk first
- Areas with good test coverage
- Frequently modified code
- High technical debt areas

## Step 3: Apply Refactorings Systematically

**Purpose**: Transform code using proven techniques.

**Refactoring Process**:
1. **Select Small Refactoring**:
   - Choose one specific improvement
   - Ensure test coverage exists
   - Keep change size manageable

2. **Apply Refactoring**:
   - Follow refactoring pattern precisely
   - Make mechanical transformations
   - Don't change behavior

3. **Run Tests**:
   - All tests must pass
   - Behavior unchanged
   - No new test failures

4. **Commit Incremental Change**:
   - Small, atomic commits
   - Clear commit messages
   - Easy to revert if needed

**Common Refactoring Patterns**:

**Extract Method**:
```python
# Before
def process_order(order):
    # validate
    if not order.customer_id:
        raise ValueError("No customer")
    if not order.items:
        raise ValueError("No items")
    # calculate
    total = sum(item.price for item in order.items)
    tax = total * 0.1
    final = total + tax
    # save
    order.total = final
    order.save()

# After
def process_order(order):
    validate_order(order)
    final = calculate_order_total(order)
    save_order(order, final)

def validate_order(order):
    if not order.customer_id:
        raise ValueError("No customer")
    if not order.items:
        raise ValueError("No items")

def calculate_order_total(order):
    total = sum(item.price for item in order.items)
    tax = total * 0.1
    return total + tax

def save_order(order, total):
    order.total = total
    order.save()
```

**Rename Variable/Method**:
```python
# Before
def d(x, y):
    return x * y * 24

# After
def calculate_daily_hours(hours_per_day, days_worked):
    return hours_per_day * days_worked * 24
```

**Replace Magic Numbers**:
```python
# Before
if score > 75:
    grade = "A"

# After
EXCELLENCE_THRESHOLD = 75
if score > EXCELLENCE_THRESHOLD:
    grade = "A"
```

**Decompose Conditional**:
```python
# Before
def calculate_shipping(order):
    if order.customer.is_premium and order.total > 100 and order.has_free_shipping:
        return 0
    elif order.customer.is_premium and order.total > 50:
        return 5
    else:
        return 10

# After
def calculate_shipping(order):
    if qualifies_for_free_shipping(order):
        return 0
    if qualifies_for_reduced_shipping(order):
        return 5
    return 10

def qualifies_for_free_shipping(order):
    return (order.customer.is_premium and 
            order.total > 100 and 
            order.has_free_shipping)

def qualifies_for_reduced_shipping(order):
    return order.customer.is_premium and order.total > 50
```

## Step 4: Maintain Test Safety Net

**Purpose**: Ensure refactoring doesn't break behavior.

**Test Strategy**:
1. **Before Refactoring**:
   - Run full test suite
   - Document test results
   - Ensure baseline success

2. **During Refactoring**:
   - Run tests after each change
   - Fix any test failures immediately
   - Don't proceed with failing tests

3. **After Refactoring**:
   - Run full test suite
   - Verify behavior unchanged
   - Check for unintended side effects

**Regression Prevention**:
- Keep test coverage high
- Tests should verify behavior, not implementation
- Add tests for edge cases discovered
- Use characterizations tests for legacy code

**Test Safety Indicators**:
✅ **Safe to refactor**:
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Tests verify behavior
- Tests are fast and reliable
- Tests document expected behavior

❌ **Risky to refactor**:
- Low or no test coverage
- Tests test implementation details
- Tests are slow or flaky
- Behavior not clearly specified

---

## Step 5: Incremental Improvement

**Purpose**: Make steady progress without big risks.

**Incremental Approach**:
1. **Small Steps**:
   - One refactoring at a time
   - Commit after each successful change
   - Run tests frequently
   - Stop if tests fail

2. **Build Confidence**:
   - Start with low-risk areas
   - Practice common refactorings
   - Learn patterns and techniques
   - Gradually tackle complex areas

3. **Track Progress**:
   - Document improvements made
   - Measure code quality metrics
   - Track technical debt reduction
   - Celebrate small wins

**Incremental Refactoring Cycle**:
```
Identify Issue → Plan Refactoring → Apply Change → Run Tests → Commit → Repeat
```

**Batching Refactorings**:
- Group related small refactorings
- Make single logical commit
- Keep batch size manageable
- Ensure all tests pass

## Step 6: Validate Improvements

**Purpose**: Confirm refactoring achieved goals.

**Validation Checklist**:
1. **Behavior Preservation**:
   - [ ] All tests pass
   - [ ] Functionality unchanged
   - [ ] No regressions introduced
   - [ ] Edge cases handled

2. **Code Quality**:

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Refactoring Anti-Patterns**:
1. **Refactoring Without Tests**: Making changes without safety net
2. **Big Bang Refactoring**: Trying to fix everything at once
3. **Mixed Changes**: Combining refactoring with feature work
4. **Premature Optimization**: Optimizing before measuring
5. **Over-Engineering**: Adding complexity for hypothetical future needs

**Process Anti-Patterns**:
1. **Ignoring Failing Tests**: Continuing despite test failures
2. **Skipping Validation**: Not confirming behavior preserved
3. **No Clear Goal**: Refactoring without specific improvement target
4. **Analysis Paralysis**: Spending too much time planning
5. **Refactoring Procrastination**: Putting off necessary improvements

## When NOT to Refactor

**Avoid Refactoring When**:
- Code is about to be replaced
- Time pressure is extreme (document for later)
- No tests available and can't add them
- Code is poorly understood and risky to change
- Business value is low (cost-benefit analysis)

**Alternatives**:
- Rewrite from scratch (for very bad code)
- Document technical debt for future
- Add tests first, then refactor
- Stabilize before improving
- Focus on new features instead
