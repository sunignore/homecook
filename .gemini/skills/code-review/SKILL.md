## Execution Steps

## Step 1: Review Preparation

**Purpose**: Understand context and scope of the code review.

**Preparation Steps**:
1. **Understand the Purpose**:
   - What problem does this code solve?
   - What are the requirements or acceptance criteria?
   - What changes are being made?

2. **Review Context**:
   - Related issues or tickets
   - Design documents or specifications
   - Previous discussions or decisions
   - Dependencies and related code

3. **Review Scope**:
   - Files changed and lines affected
   - Complexity of changes
   - Risk level (high-risk areas need more scrutiny)
   - Testing coverage included

**Preparation Checklist**:
- [ ] Understand the purpose and requirements
- [ ] Review related documentation
- [ ] Identify high-risk areas
- [ ] Check test coverage
- [ ] Set review focus areas

## Step 2: Code Quality Assessment

**Purpose**: Evaluate code for correctness and maintainability.

**Quality Criteria**:
1. **Correctness**:
   - Does the code solve the intended problem?
   - Are there obvious bugs or logic errors?
   - Are edge cases handled?
   - Is error handling appropriate?

2. **Readability**:
   - Is the code easy to understand?
   - Are variable and function names descriptive?
   - Is the logic clear and straightforward?
   - Are comments helpful and accurate?

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Is the code modular and well-organized?
   - Are functions/classes focused on single responsibilities?
   - Is the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)?
   - Is it easy to modify or extend?

4. **Performance**:
   - Are there obvious performance issues?
   - Are algorithms and data structures appropriate?
   - Are there unnecessary computations or allocations?
   - Is database access optimized?

**Review Focus Areas**:
- High-risk code (security, data handling, payments)
- Complex logic or algorithms
- Error handling and edge cases
- Database queries and I/O operations
- Resource management (memory, connections, files)

## Step 3: Security Review

**Purpose**: Identify security vulnerabilities and potential exploits.

**Security Checklist**:
1. **Input Validation**:
   - Are user inputs validated and sanitized?
   - Is there protection against injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection)?
   - Are file uploads properly validated?

2. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Are authentication checks properly implemented?
   - Are authorization checks enforced consistently?
   - Are sensitive operations protected?

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Are sensitive data properly handled?
   - Are secrets/credentials properly stored?
   - Is data encrypted at rest and in transit?
   - Is logging free of sensitive information?

4. **Dependencies**:
   - Are dependencies up-to-date and secure?
   - Are there known vulnerabilities in dependencies?
   - Are dependencies from trusted sources?

**Common Security Issues**:
- SQL injection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Authentication bypass
- Authorization flaws
- Sensitive data exposure
- Cryptographic weaknesses
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Insecure dependencies

## Step 4: Testing Assessment

**Purpose**: Evaluate test coverage and quality.

**Testing Review**:
1. **Test Coverage**:
   - Are new features tested?
   - Are edge cases covered?
   - Is error handling tested?
   - Are there integration tests?

2. **Test Quality**:
   - Are tests clear and focused?
   - Do tests have good assertions?
   - Are test cases realistic?
   - Are tests maintainable?

3. **Test Gaps**:
   - What scenarios aren't tested?
   - What edge cases are missing?
   - What error conditions aren't covered?
   - What integration points aren't tested?

**Testing Recommendations**:
- Add unit tests for untested functions
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Add tests for edge cases
- Add tests for error conditions
- Improve test assertions and clarity

## Step 5: Standards Compliance

**Purpose**: Ensure code follows project conventions and best practices.

**Standards Checklist**:
1. **Code Style**:
   - Does code follow project style guide?
   - Is formatting consistent (indentation, spacing)?
   - Are naming conventions followed?
   - Is file organization consistent?

2. **Architecture Patterns**:
   - Are design patterns used appropriately?
   - Is the code consistent with existing architecture?
   - Are separation of concerns maintained?
   - Are dependencies managed properly?

3. **Documentation**:
   - Is complex code documented?
   - Are public APIs documented?
   - Are comments helpful and accurate?
   - Is README or CHANGELOG updated?

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Are language/framework best practices followed?
   - Are anti-patterns avoided?
   - Is code idiomatic for the language?
   - Are performance considerations addressed?

## Step 6: Feedback Delivery

**Purpose**: Provide constructive, actionable feedback.

**Feedback Principles**:
1. **Be Specific**:
   - Point to exact code locations
   - Explain why something is problematic
   - Provide concrete examples
   - Suggest specific improvements

2. **Be Constructive**:
   - Focus on the code, not the coder
   - Explain the reasoning behind feedback
   - Offer solutions, not just problems
   - Acknowledge good parts of the code

3. **Prioritize Issues**:
   - **Must Fix**: Critical bugs, security issues, breaking changes
   - **Should Fix**: Important improvements, maintainability issues
   - **Nice to Have**: Minor optimizations, style improvements
   - **Future Consideration**: Ideas for future improvements

4. **Balance Feedback**:
   - Start with positive observations
   - Group related issues together
   - Provide explanations for suggestions
   - End constructively

**Feedback Structure**:
```markdown
## Summary

4. **Solution Forcing**: Suggesting preferred approach without considering trade-offs
5. **Delay Tactics**: Holding up reviews for minor issues

**Feedback Anti-Patterns**:
1. **Vague Criticism**: "This is bad" without explanation
2. **Negativity Bias**: Only commenting on problems, not strengths
