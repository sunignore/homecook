## Execution Steps

## Step 1: Audience Analysis

**Purpose**: Understand who will read the documentation and their needs.

**Audience Assessment**:
1. **Technical Level**:
   - Technical experts (developers, engineers)
   - Technical users (power users, administrators)
   - Non-technical users (end users, general audience)
   - Mixed audiences

2. **Knowledge Base**:
   - What prior knowledge do they have?
   - What terminology will they understand?
   - What concepts need explanation?
   - What examples will resonate?

3. **Use Context**:
   - When will they use this documentation?
   - What problem are they trying to solve?
   - What's their urgency or stress level?
   - What format do they prefer?

4. **Accessibility Needs**:
   - Language requirements (English, Korean, multi-language)
   - Reading level considerations
   - Format preferences (visual, text, interactive)
   - Disability accommodations

**Output**: Audience profile with characteristics and needs

## Step 2: Information Architecture

**Purpose**: Structure documentation for clarity and navigation.

**Structuring Principles**:
1. **Hierarchical Organization**:
   - Overview → Details → Reference
   - High-level concepts → Specific tasks
   - General information → Edge cases

2. **Progressive Disclosure**:
   - Start with essentials
   - Reveal complexity gradually
   - Link to detailed information
   - Provide multiple depth levels

3. **Logical Flow**:
   - Chronological (step-by-step processes)
   - Task-based (common user goals)
   - Conceptual (building understanding)
   - Reference (alphabetical, searchable)

4. **Navigation Design**:
   - Table of contents
   - Section headers and subheaders
   - Cross-references and links
   - Index or search keywords

**Common Documentation Structures**:
- **Getting Started Guide**: Setup → First steps → Common tasks
- **User Manual**: Overview → Features → Instructions → Reference
- **Technical Guide**: Architecture → Implementation → API → Examples
- **Troubleshooting**: Symptoms → Causes → Solutions → Prevention

**Output**: Documentation outline with structure and flow

## Step 3: Content Creation

**Purpose**: Write clear, actionable content.

**Writing Principles**:
1. **Clarity First**:
   - Use simple, direct language
   - One idea per sentence
   - Active voice over passive
   - Specific over general

2. **Accessibility**:
   - Define technical terms on first use
   - Provide examples and analogies
   - Use visual aids (diagrams, screenshots)
   - Consider non-native speakers

3. **Actionability**:
   - Start with verbs for instructions
   - Provide step-by-step procedures
   - Include expected results
   - Add troubleshooting guidance

4. **Scannability**:
   - Use bullet points and lists
   - Highlight important information
   - Break text into short paragraphs
   - Use descriptive headers

**Content Types**:
1. **Procedural Content**:
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Numbered lists for sequences
   - Conditional steps (if/then)
   - Warnings and cautions

2. **Conceptual Content**:
   - Explanations and definitions
   - Examples and use cases
   - Diagrams and illustrations
   - Analogies and comparisons

3. **Reference Content**:
   - Tables and matrices
   - Code examples and snippets
   - Configuration options
   - Error messages and solutions

**Output**: Complete documentation content with clear structure

---

## Step 4: Visual Communication

**Purpose**: Enhance understanding with visual elements.

**Visual Design Guidelines**:
1. **Diagrams and Flowcharts**:
   - Use for processes and workflows
   - Keep simple and focused
   - Label all elements clearly
   - Include legends if needed

2. **Screenshots and Images**:
   - Show actual interface elements
   - Highlight important areas
   - Add annotations and callouts
   - Maintain consistent style

3. **Tables and Charts**:
   - Organize complex information
   - Use clear headers and labels
   - Highlight key data points
   - Provide context and interpretation

4. **Code Examples**:
   - Show working examples
   - Add comments explaining code
   - Use syntax highlighting
   - Include expected output

**Visual Accessibility**:
- Provide text alternatives (alt text)
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Use readable fonts and sizes
- Consider color blindness

**Output**: Visual elements that enhance understanding
