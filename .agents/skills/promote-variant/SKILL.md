# Skill: promote-variant

## When to Use

Use this skill after all `PROMOTION_CHECKLIST.md` conditions are satisfied in `Projects/homecook/`.

**Prerequisites**:
- All PROMOTION_CHECKLIST.md conditions show Done
- `bun scripts/audit.ts` passes (0 errors)
- `bun run agent:verify` passes (0 errors)
- User has reviewed `_ORIGIN.md §Manual Phase B Steps`
- **No promotion hold**: the source project's `variant.json` must NOT contain
  `promotionHold: { hold: true }`. A hold blocks `l3-to-variant-pipeline.ts`
  (Phase 0.5) and `project-to-variant.ts` mechanically and cannot be bypassed
  with `--force` — the owner removes the hold only after the user approves the
  promotion in plain language. Green readiness checks are not an approval.

---

## Phase B Process

### Step 1: Final verification

```bash
cd Projects/homecook

# Verify all conditions
bun run agent:verify          # Conditions 1, 5
bun scripts/validate-skills.ts  # Condition 2
bun scripts/audit.ts          # Conditions 3, 4

# Review PROMOTION_CHECKLIST.md manually
# Conditions 6, 7 require human review
```

All conditions must show Done before proceeding.

### Step 1.5: Verify country-profile readiness

Run the country-profile criteria rows from `docs/templates/PROMOTION_CHECKLIST-template.md` (Criteria 1) — these gate promotion for both country-shipping and region-neutral variants:

- [ ] `country_config` valid (if the prototype ships country profiles): `supported` list declared, `default: null` (region-neutral default), and every `supported` code has a `docs/countries/<CODE>.md` profile with matching frontmatter `code`
- [ ] Country-specific assets (skills, env keys) registered in `country_scoped_assets` in both schema copies - nothing ships unregistered, and there are no variant-local forks of registry-governed scoped skills
- [ ] Region-neutral default intact: docs and agents reference a jurisdiction only via the active country profile or explicit `(CC: ...)` markers - no hardcoded target-jurisdiction assumptions in default paths

A region-neutral prototype passes by confirming the second and third checks only (no unregistered scoped assets leaked in).

### Step 2: Update pre-promotion metadata

Before running the pipeline, update these fields in `Projects/homecook/`:

**`variant.json`**:
- Confirm `inherits_common` matches current workspace common version
- `phaseAComplete`: leave as `false` (pipeline sets this)

**`_ORIGIN.md`**:
- Confirm §Manual Phase B Steps lists all domain-specific folders
- Confirm §Reconcile Survival Notes is complete

### Step 3: Run l3-to-variant-pipeline.ts

```bash
# From workspace root C:\git\
bun scripts/l3-to-variant-pipeline.ts \
  --source Projects/homecook \
  --variant co-homecook \
  --variantType <security|development|design|consulting|collaboration> \
  --auto-fix-agents-md \
  --auto-fix-pm-md
```

Expected output:
- `templates/co-homecook/` created
- Common files reconciled (duplicates removed)
- Platform parity validated
- Domain skills materialized into all three skill roots (`skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/`) — no manual copying (generate-variant.ts ≥ 1.12.0)
- Agent `lifecycle` frontmatter preserved on the variant copy — no post-run backfills (generate-variant.ts ≥ 1.12.0)
- VARIANT-INJECT markers ensured in `docs/co-homecook.context.md` even when the L3 source overwrites the marker-rich skeleton
- `AGENTS.md` regenerated with the full roster (`--auto-fix-agents-md`, via `regenerate-agents-md.ts --source`)

### Step 4: Manual copy — pipeline-excluded directories

Check `_ORIGIN.md §Manual Phase B Steps` for domain-specific folders NOT scanned by the pipeline.

Common exclusions (must copy manually):
```bash
# Domain-specific directories (not auto-scanned by reconcile):
cp -r Projects/homecook/workflows  templates/co-homecook/workflows
cp -r Projects/homecook/regulations  templates/co-homecook/regulations
cp -r Projects/homecook/evidence-models  templates/co-homecook/evidence-models
cp -r Projects/homecook/industry-profiles  templates/co-homecook/industry-profiles
# Add others per _ORIGIN.md
```

### Step 5: Verify common skills in generated template

```bash
ls templates/co-homecook/.claude/skills/
ls templates/co-homecook/.gemini/skills/
```

If common skills were stripped by reconcile (identical to L0), manually restore:
```bash
cp -r templates/common/.claude/skills/. templates/co-homecook/.claude/skills/
cp -r templates/common/.gemini/skills/. templates/co-homecook/.gemini/skills/
```

> **Reconcile boundary**: `l3-to-variant-pipeline.ts` strips files from L2 that are identical to L0. Skills (`.claude/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/`) are **excluded from reconcile** and must always be present in L2. If skills are missing after pipeline run, restore them manually from `templates/common/.claude/skills/` and `templates/common/.gemini/skills/`.

### Step 6: Verify new-project.ts picks up the new variant

`bun scripts/new-project.ts` automatically detects valid variants from `templates/` at runtime — **no manual update required**.

Verify detection works:
```bash
bun scripts/new-project.ts --help
# Should list co-<name> in the available variants output
```

### Step 6.5: Verify Antigravity coverage

Before running validate-templates.ts, confirm Antigravity parity is complete:

```bash
# Verify .gemini/ mirrors .claude/
diff <(ls templates/co-homecook/.claude/commands/) \
     <(ls templates/co-homecook/.gemini/commands/)
diff <(ls templates/co-homecook/.claude/skills/) \
     <(ls templates/co-homecook/.gemini/skills/)
```

Check that:
- [ ] All commands in `.claude/commands/` have a matching file in `.gemini/commands/` (or explicit `gemini-parity: skip` frontmatter)
- [ ] All skills in `.claude/skills/` have a matching file in `.gemini/skills/` (or `gemini-parity: skip`)
- [ ] `GEMINI.md` variant context section identical to `CLAUDE.md` variant context section
- [ ] Each `agents/*.md` file has Section C (Antigravity Integration)

If any gap found: fix before running validate-templates.ts.

### Step 7: Run validate-templates.ts

```bash
# From workspace root C:\git\
bun scripts/validate-templates.ts
```

Fix any P-01 parity failures before proceeding.

### Step 8: Update lifecycle metadata

**`templates/co-homecook/variant.json`**:
```json
{
  "status": "beta",
  "lifecycle": {
    "statusSince": "<today-date>",
    "lastTransition": "beta -> promoted on <today-date>",
    "stablePromotedOn": null
  }
}
```

**`Projects/homecook/variant.json`**:
```json
{
  "phaseAComplete": true
}
```

### Step 9: Run tag-template.ts

After all template changes are committed and verified:

```bash
# From workspace root C:\git\
bun scripts/tag-template.ts
```

This publishes a `template-v{VERSION}` git tag.

### Step 10: Update workspace AGENTS.md

Add the new variant to the workspace root `AGENTS.md` if it has a unique agent roster that should be documented.

Run:
```bash
bun run agent:verify
```

## Post-Promotion Checklist

- [ ] `templates/co-<name>/` created and passes validate-templates.ts
- [ ] Bilingual user guide authored: `templates/co-<name>/docs/user-guide.md` + `docs/user-guide_ko.md` per the User-Guide Standard (enforced by validate-templates WS-11; reference: `templates/co-work/docs/`)

- [ ] `templates/co-<name>/variant.json` status is `beta` with correct lifecycle dates
- [ ] `Projects/homecook/variant.json` has `phaseAComplete: true`
- [ ] `tag-template.ts` run and tag published
- [ ] Workspace AGENTS.md updated (if needed)
- [ ] `SECURITY.md` completed (not just stub)

## Testing the New Variant

After Phase B, verify `bun scripts/new-project.ts` creates a working instance:

```bash
# Dry run (if supported):
bun scripts/new-project.ts "my-test-project" --variant co-<name>

# Verify created project structure:
ls Projects/my-test-project/
```

## Skill Graph Note

Since `l3-to-variant-pipeline.ts` v1.13.0, Phase 6.5 regenerates and verifies the
promoted variant's scope skill graph automatically. If it reports non-zero (e.g. older
generator in the promoted output), run manually:
`bun scripts/generate-skill-graph.ts --scope co-<name> && bun scripts/verify-skill-graph.ts --scope co-<name>`
(ADR-0060 Amendment 6; `tests/add-variant-relations.ts` can backfill typed relations
from the variant's new procedure corpus — idempotent).
